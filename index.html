	<p>Welcome to my video game portfolio website. Here you can find information about my gaming experience, favorite games, and gaming-related projects.</p>

	<h2>Game 1</h2>
    <p>I chose this as my first game simply because of the way you can play with freind and how you can play by your self and still have fun. Although this game has many players it is still my number one game. I play this game a lot considering it has come out last October.</p>
